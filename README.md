# PoolParty
My attempt at a simple distributed database system you can setup at home with some
raspberry Pi's. 

## New Approach
Previous attempts failed to complete anything useful because they frankly were trying to 
solve too complex a problem. Distributed computing is not only about completing the same
task with cooperation of resources from many machines. Web services often rely on distributed databases to spread storage of data to help balance load and improve redundancy. 

There's also P2P applications like group messaging/voice or torrenting. These applications
Aren't really trying to do computation whatsoever, and are doing more than just distributing resources for retrieval as well. 

So clearly the landscape of distributed computing is more nuanced than it may seem. This is why I've decided to tackle a more focused task: a distributed database system. 

I have a lot of projects I work on, and having a kind of "cloud" that I've created seems like a neat idea and a good way to continue this project. 

## Previous Modular Design (single purpose, multi-machine task)
* basic btc price analytics and monitoring *(under development)*
* distributed file system/file syncing *(under development)*
