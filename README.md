# PoolParty
My own DIY attempt at a small P2P kind of distributed computing system

## Distributed Computing Projects Attempted (![see v0.2](https://github.com/scott-robbins/PoolParty/tree/master/code/0.2))
* security camera  *(under development)*
* basic btc price analytics and monitoring *(under development)*
* distributed file system/file syncing *(under development)*

## New Approach
I want to make this more flexible because the system I had before was: 
	A) not scalable at all for more node which is a pretty essential benefit of distributed computing.
	B) Really rigid in defining jobs, no real communication between nodes, the previous attempt did not really
	   create a network so much as a fleet of bots you can *kinda* control with a configuration file.
To see what the latest development is up to ![visit v0.3](https://github.com/scott-robbins/PoolParty/tree/master/code/0.3)
