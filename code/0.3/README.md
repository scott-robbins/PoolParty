# PoolParty_v0.3
Previous designs helped me figure out how to make pretty neat functionality for machines
controlling each others remotely (command execution, file transfer, etc.). This next version
will try and build on that foundation, and create ways to have machines work together on common
tasks. This should work better now that the fundamentals are more solid.
