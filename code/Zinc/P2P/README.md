A project to work on (and I'm finding also discover) essential challenges related to 
programming peer to peer applications and networks. So far it's been a great way to help
distribute loads for some tasks, like the bitcoin price tracker which utilizes a desktop
continuously online and collecting data and leaving me free to use other machines to manipulate
copies of the up to date data. 

I'm also planning to tackle some file synchronization and distributed network ideas but thus 
far it has been challenging (but fun!) running into some fairly classic problems with how to handle
processes that have a tendency to lock a system up when they run into the wall (like se)
